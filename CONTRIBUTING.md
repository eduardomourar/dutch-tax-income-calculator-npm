## Yearly Data Resource

Each year, the Dutch tax system undergoes adjustments, and the updated numbers can be found in the Nieuwsbrief Loonheffingen {YEAR}. For example, the information for the year 2024 is available in  [Nieuwsbrief Loonheffingen 2024](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/themaoverstijgend/brochures_en_publicaties/nieuwsbrief-loonheffingen-2024)

## Test Data Resource

As the yearly data changes, it's essential to keep the test data up to date. You can download the test data from the [Belastingdienst](
https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/personeel-en-loon/content/hulpmiddel-loonbelastingtabellen)(Tax Administration):

- Choose the relevant year.
- Select the country as the Netherlands.
- Choose "Time period table".
- Opt for the "Standard situation".
- Choose the "White" chart.
- Set the period to "Month".
- Select the "Excel" format.

Download the file and adjust it to the CSV format, using `__test__/test-tax-20xx.csv` as a reference/example. Ensure that the test data aligns with the most recent changes in the tax system.
