## Yearly Data Resource

Each year, the Dutch tax system undergoes adjustments, and the updated numbers can be found in the Nieuwsbrief Loonheffingen {YEAR}. For example, the information for the year 2024 is available in  [Nieuwsbrief Loonheffingen 2024](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/themaoverstijgend/brochures_en_publicaties/nieuwsbrief-loonheffingen-2024)

## Test Data Resource

As the yearly data changes, it's essential to keep the test data up to date. You can download the test data from the [Belastingdienst](
https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/personeel-en-loon/content/hulpmiddel-loonbelastingtabellen)(Tax Administration):

- Choose the relevant year.
- Select the country as the Netherlands.
- Choose "Time period table".
- Opt for the "Standard situation".
- Choose the "White" chart.
- Set the period to "Month".
- Select the "Excel" format.

Take a look at the files in the `__tests__` folder for reference. To create such file from the Excel you will need to:

- Open the downloaded Excel
- Remove the columns labeled "met loonheffingskorting incl. alleenstaande-ouderenkorting" (7th column, "G") and "met loonheffingskorting incl. alleenstaande-ouderenkorting" (11th column, "K"). Ensure that the test data aligns with the most recent changes in the tax system. 
- Depending on your locale, ensure correct number formatting (no thousand seperator, dot decimal seperator)
- Remove remarks from the bottom rows
- Remove unneeded header row and copy/paste the header row from a previous year
- Save as `test-taxs-YYYY.csv`
